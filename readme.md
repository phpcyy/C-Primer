Way to explore C language.

I have never learnt C language systemly. But on my work, I have to face many systems and services built by  C language such as Redis, MySQL, Linux, PHP etc. So, to avoid and diverge them is hardly, and I have so many dobuts to understand how they works and what is more effective way to use them.

As a result, I start to learn C language again from the primary courses. When I was a freshman in my university, I had learnt C++ courses a little. I hope to mastery C language in coming months or years.

Good luck to me.
